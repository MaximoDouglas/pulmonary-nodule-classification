# Pulmonary nodule classification

Automatic classification on Pulmonary Nodules of Computed Tomography Image - Dicom.

# Initial ideas
1. Data exploration (initialy, just visualizations) on the Features dataset;
2. Create a classifier (CNN) using the images as inputs;
3. Create a classifier that uses the Features and Images as Input of the network;
4. Create a CNN archtecture wich receives the images as input and injects the Features after the flatten layer.
